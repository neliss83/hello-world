# hello-world
A beginning for me as a developer. Ultimately looking forward to many more. ;-)

I started out ages ago writing BASIC on an old IBM PC Junior. That was the most fun I had ever remembered having. I did not do any coding again until 2007 in college. While taking course in graphic design, I was writing HTML, CSS, and ActionScript 2. I have coded on many occasions but have never truly commited to being a developer. I am a Linux user, and prefer it over Mac or Windows (having been a power user of both). I value efficient software, with a commitment to letting the work be done with a minimum of overhead and meeting gthe needs of the users using it. In the non-digital world, I enjoy working wuith my hands on nearly anything. I love photography with my DSLR, even if it is over 10 years old. Custom firmware on the CF makes it more fun. An avid gamer as well, I like to retro game, and have been known to play some RL. I enjoy science fiction, fantasy, quantum mechanics, astronomy, and too many other things to list here. Moving forward I want to make sure everyday I have a positive affect on at least one person, and learn something new every day.
